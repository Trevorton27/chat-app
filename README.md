This is a readme file. :-)
More to come but, suffice to say, I am currently involved in getting this app to work before actually writing any documentation about it in terms of how it works and what it is using.

The eventual goal is to create a chat app that uses Python as a back end server, Flask as an internal API, SQLAlchemy as an ORM, POstgreSQL as a database and ReactJS for the front end.

I will also gain some experience writing unit tests. :-)
